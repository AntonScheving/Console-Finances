# Console-Finances

## Description

I have been tasked with creating code for analyzing the financial records of a company.
The JavaScript code analyzes the records provided by the company to calculate the following:

* The total number of months included in the dataset.

* The net total amount of Profit/Losses over the entire period.

* The average of the changes in Profit/Losses over the entire period.

* The total change in profits from month to month and the average.

* The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period.

* The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period.
